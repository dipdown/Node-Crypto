# About Aligned Layer
Zero-knowledge and validity proofs have gained attention due to their capabilities in decentralized private computation, scaling blockchains, identity protocols, and verifiable machine learning, among others. They allow one party, the prover, to show to other parties, the verifiers, that a given statement is true in a time- and memory-efficient way. Zero-knowledge proofs allow us to prove the statement without revealing anything else other than its validity. They are becoming one of the main building blocks in web3. However, even though the technology has been around since the mid 1980's, it was not at the heart of Bitcoin and Ethereum due to the lack of efficient constructions for such applications. This leads to restrictions in the types of proof systems we can verify, introduces overhead in verification time and costs in Ethereum, and also increases development and go-to-market times, since we have to optimize the verification contracts to reduce gas usage (and, therefore, costs). Aligned Layer, powered by EigenLayer, provides a decentralized network of verifiers that can check proofs from any proof system in a fast and cost-effective way.\

# Installation
- Open [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
- Create a new workspace and paste repository on Github
- Paste the code to terminal and running
  ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipdown/Node-Crypto/main/AlignedLayer/alignedlayer.sh && chmod +x alignedlayer.sh && ./alignedlayer.sh
   ```
- If done, go to "nexus-project" folder
- Download the "nexus-proof"
- Done

# Next Task
- Capture a screenshot of your terminal.
- Post on X with the following caption:
  ```sh
